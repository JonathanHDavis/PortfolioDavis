		<em>"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"</em>
	</p>

	<p> 
		This movie took the world by storm. No one had seen a movie quite like this before. 
	</p>

	<p>
		It combined drama, action, political intrigue, and even magic and imaginary creatures. It brought together all types of people who could each find something to enjoy. 
	</p>
	
	<p>	
		The old and young, the nerdy and cool, the main stream and unique, could each see this movie and pinpoint a specific part they enjoyed above the rest.

	<p>
		<em>"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"</em>
	</p>

	<p>
		The second chapter cranked everything up about 1,000 notches.
	</p>

	<p>
		As much as the scale was trememndous in the first one, this movie added so much more. There is a battle sequence that lasts about 45 minutes and it is absolutely mind blowing.
	</p>

	<p>
		What people admire most about these movies is in these huge battles, there were very few visual effects, it was mostly done through hard work with practical camera tricks.

	<p>
		<em>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"</em>
	</p>

	<p>
		This movie man, this freaking movie. AMAZING!
	</p>

	<p>
		The trilogy ends so perfectly with this final chapter. Everything the first two did this one combined and added in closure and more incredible drama.
	</p>

	<p>
		It made all of the money and has the record for most Academy Awards for any one film, including Best Picture and Best Director.
	</p>

	<p>
		No movie like it has ever had this much commercial and critical success, and it is a testament to what a nearly flawless project this entire series came to be.
