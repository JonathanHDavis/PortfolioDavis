<p>
	For as long as I can remember, I have been bored. I did what one is  supposed to do. I went to college, I studied, I started Law School. 
</p>

<p>
	Anytime I had a fun notion in my mind, I pushed it back and made more room for the practical. I loved film, the culniary arts, things that feuled a creative mind, but I was getting sick of the status quo. 
</p>

<p>
	It was time for something new. I needed a place to channel my creative instincts but still challenge my brain.
</p>

<p>
	I started to hear multiple people suggest coding school to fit these needs. At first I thought this was insane. I could not be less of a computer person and it just did not seem to be right for me.
</p>

<p>
	As I did more research I understood why people felt this was the right choice. Web development is a fascinating subject!
</p>

<p>
	I can take my creative mind and ideas and use the practical and technical world of computers to make them a reality.
</p>

<p>
	I am very excited to dive head-first into coding and see where it can take my mind.
